        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p><b>NewJeans</b> (Korean: 뉴진스; RR: <i>Nyujinseu</i>) is a South Korean girl group 
        formed by ADOR, a sub-label of Hybe. The group is composed of five members: 
        Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin, and Hyein. Mainly produced by Min Hee-jin, 
        they are known for their 'girl next door' image and musical stylings reminiscent 
        of the 1990s and 2000s.</p>
        <p>The group debuted under the name NewJeans on July 22, 2022, with the single "Attention", their first number-one song 
        on South Korea's Circle Digital Chart. It was followed shortly afterwards by two other singles, "Hype Boy" and "Cookie", 
        with the former becoming the longest-running song on the Billboard Global 200 by a K-pop female act. The singles were all 
        featured on their eponymous debut extended play (EP), released in August 2022. In January 2023, they released their first 
        single album, OMG, to commercial success. It was accompanied by two singles, "Ditto" and "OMG". "Ditto" gained widespread popularity, 
        becoming the longest-running number-one song on the Circle Digital Chart and the group's first entry on both the Billboard 
        Hot 100 and the UK Singles Chart.</p>
        <p>Their second EP, <i>Get Up</i>, peaked at number one on the US Billboard 200 and sold over one million copies in South Korea. Its lead single, "Super Shy", 
        became the group's highest-charting single on the Billboard Global 200 (number two), the US Billboard Hot 100, and the UK Singles Chart. NewJeans has 
        received rookie awards and was featured in listicles such as Time Next Generation Leaders and Forbes Korea Power Celebrity 40. IFPI named NewJeans 
        the eighth best-selling artist worldwide in 2023.</p>
        <p>In 2024, a conflict regarding management actions and control of the group broke out, with former ADOR CEO Min Hee-jin and NewJeans' 
        members opposing Hybe and ADOR's top executives. On November 28, NewJeans' members announced the termination of their exclusive contract 
        over alleged violations and subsequently opened new social media accounts. ADOR refuted the alleged contract breaches, claiming that the 
        contract still stands, and petitioned to the court to enforce its validity. On February 7, 2025, the group announced that they would be 
        changing their name to <b>NJZ</b> (엔제이지; <i>Enjeiji</i>).</p>
